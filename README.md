# SoccerScores

This script was written in Ruby. Data is pulled in, so that you can get live and current scores for today's soccer matches. If you are working with data that deals heavily with soccer scores, then this script will help

# Running Script

To run the script, you will need to install ruby to your machine. Go to the directory that holds the information, which will probably be SoccerScores. Then type in the following command: Ruby ESPNData.rb.

# Outputs

There will be two files that output to the same directory and then will both be named #{Date.today}.csv and #{Date.today}.txt. 

# Future implementation

The idea would be to produce more csv and text files for different types of sports, such as NCAA Men's Basketball, NBA, NFL, etc.
